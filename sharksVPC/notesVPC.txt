VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)

1. Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) gives you complete control over your 
virtual networking environment, including resource placement, connectivity, 
and security. 
2. With VPC we achive network isolation
3. VPC is a private cloud inside Puplic Cloud 
4. Inside VPC we create Subnets(Sub Networks). 2 types of Subnets --> Public and Private 
5. Difference between Public and Private subnets is Public Subnets have internet connectivity but Private 
Subnets don't have. 
6. Can Subnets in the same VPC have overlapping IP CIDRs? Answer is No. 
7. By default Subnets are private. 
8. Public Route Table --> In order to make it public we need to add Internet Gateway and associate with 
public Subnets
9. Private Route Table --> Traffic remains local to VPC, it means traffic doesn't go outside of VPC 

Security in VPC 

1. NACL --> Network Access Control List is stateless. It means once define inbound rules we must explicitly
define outbound rules as well.
1.2 NACLs work in Subnet level
1.3 NACLs go with rule numbers (for example: 100, 101, 200 and etc.)
2. SG --> Security Group. SG is statefull, means once we define inbound(ingress, incoming) rules we don't 
have to define outbound(egress, outgoung) rules. It's automatically allowed. 
2.1 SGs work in EC2 level
